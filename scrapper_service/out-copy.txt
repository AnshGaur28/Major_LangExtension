This institution of higher learning has immensely contributed to the nation building by providing intellect talent possessing latest analytical, design, practical and managerial skills.

Our competent faculty and the State of The Art infrastructure together with compulsory 6 months internship programme at an industry of repute help them in developing their overall personality to meet the challenges at global level and come out with the optimum solutions. It is my strong belief that given an opportunity, the students of this great temple of learning will prove an asset to the recruiting organisations.

There are members from every branch, be it circuital or non-circuital with only one thing in common, curiosity. So, if you ever wanted to know bumper to bumper about the mechanical horse you see everywhere grab a seat and fasten your seatbelts. We will teach you everything you need ranging from suspensions, engines, transmissions, gears and so on, so at the end you can contribute in completing the ultimate goal of the society, designing and manufacturing the formula -1 vehicle (FSAE) and the off-roader (BAJA). The society works on the principle of learn and teach; hence there will be seniors, around the clock to help you resolve an issue. Our society offers numerous chances, but in order to take use of them, you must be a part of it. The question is, are you diligent enough? Every member of society is hired following a rigorous written test and a personal interview. So, if you believe you have the drive and vision to shape the future, you could be the next. SAE INDIA is an affiliate of the SAE INTERNATIONAL Organisation which undertakes the organisation of the following events every year: SUPRA SAE INDIA BAJA SUPRA SAE INDIA: It is an inter-college competition to design, manufacture and race an F1 prototype track racing vehicle that has to race on the prestigious Buddh International Circuit against other college teams. It is an experience of a lifetime to make a vehicle of that sort and to drive it on a track where legends like Michael Schumacher have driven is a dream come true for us students. BAJA: BAJA is also an inter-college competition to design, manufacture and race but, an off-road vehicle in the muddy track of Indore. This is completely different from SUPRA in terms of muddy track, high ground clearances, off road experience and a whole new dimension of rally racing. Our college has been participating in this competition for the past 6 years now and has proven its metal by giving 2 podium finishes in just 6 competitions. How would it help students by joining SAE? Students become a part of not just a college society but a bigger family all around the world. Developing design skills in the field of automotive engineering Building a vehicle from the ground up provides an experience like no other. Members get to design BAJA buggy and FSAE car and in doing so, understand all the technical aspects of the vehicle. It also helps to develop a problem-solving mindset. Students would get the chance to participate in national events where they can show off their talents and at the same time learn about a lot of new innovations other teams bring along with them. SAE Members get access to first-to-market technical insights, best-in-class technical resources, and connections with a global network of leading industry experts. Members also receive discounts on professional development, publications, and more. S.No. Name Position Contact No. Email 1.

Not forgetting about the latter part of our motto, the club has also organized events like In-reach and Fin-o-knowledge to help young students develop better financial knowledge and learn more about various avenues of approach in their professional careers and how to work towards developing upon these career paths. Keeping in line with the tradition of sticking to its holistic development approach, the club aims to undertake further such activities in the coming sessions. Since college is all about learning, experiencing and exploring who one is, Rotaract Club provides the best platform to kickstart this journey. The club not only helps develop a sense of service towards society but also helps each individual look for who they are and develop upon that while working towards building new skills.

It is a noble experiment in academic extension. It inculcates the spirit of voluntary work among students and teachers through sustained community interaction. It brings our academic institutions closer to the society. It is a link between the campus and community, the college and village, knowledge and action. The overall aim of NSS is the Personality Development of students through community service. It gives an extension dimension to Higher Education system and orients the student youth to community service. The youth in all ages has been in the vanguard of progress and social change, thirst for freedom, impatience for quicker pace of progress and a passion for innovation, coupled with idealism and creative fervour, saw the youth in the forefront of the freedom struggle in our own land. Ever since independence there has been growing awareness of the desirability of involving students in National Service. The first Education Commission (1950) recommended the introduction of national service by students on a voluntary basis, but NSS was officially included in the curriculum for University students, along with National Sports Organization (NSO) and National Cadet Corps (NCC), after the Conference of State Education Ministers in April 1967. National Service Scheme, popularly known as NSS, was formally launched on 24th September, 1969, the birth centenary of the Father of the Nation. 24th September is celebrated every year as NSS Day nationwide. The scheme now extends to all the states and universities in the country. Students, teachers, parents, guardians, persons in authority in government, universities and colleges and the people in general now realize the need and significance of NSS. NSS is, thus a concrete attempt in making education relevant to the needs of the society. Objectives understand the community in which they work; understand themselves in relation to their community; identify the needs and problems of the community and involve them in problem solving process; develop among themselves a sense of social and civic responsibility; utilize their knowledge in finding practical solution to individual and community problems; develop competence required for group living and sharing of responsibilities; gain skills in mobilizing community participation; acquire leadership qualities and democratic attitude; develop capacity to meet emergencies and natural disasters; practice national integration and social harmony. NSS Logo The symbol of the NSS is based on the Rath wheel of the Konark Sun Temple situated in Orissa. These giant wheels of the Sun Temple portray the cycle of creation, preservation and release, and signify the movement in life across time and space. It stands for community as well as change and implies the continuous striving of National Service Scheme for social transformation and upliftment. NSS Moto The motto of NSS is 'NOT ME BUT YOU' . This reflects the essence of democratic living and upholds the need for selfless service and appreciation of the other persons point of view and also to show consideration for fellow human beings.

The project covers the students of all classes and children are taught five days a week. Their teaching involves Content Teaching, Interactive sessions, Test series and Quizzes with the help of videos and presentations. All records are properly maintained and attendance is taken regularly. Regular teaching is an integral part. From time to time, special events such as movies are organized for the children to offer them a break from the studies and keep them refreshed. This project has time and again proved to be the most successful venture of NSS. Drishti Drishti project is a film making project which was started under NSS PEC. The project has ever since promoted awareness through its short films and scintillating videos in general public. This project provides a platform for students to not only increase social awareness on prominent humanitarian issues in society but also enjoy the thrill of making short films. The students involved in this project have made short movies such as "Aasra", "Expectations", "A Lost Battle" and "A Shot At Glory". With the success of every new short film or movie, this project is moving forward and proving to be a brilliant venture on the part of NSS, PEC. Sparsh Project Sparsh is an initiative by the NSS Unit of PEC to help the blind students excel in academics despite of their disability. For the execution of this project the University has collaborated with, The Institute for the Blind, Sector 26, Chandigarh (the only institute for the blind in the tri-city). The volunteers of this project record the content from the books that are provided by the blind school. Currently the recordings are done using the help of mobiles and laptops. The recordings are then sent to the blind school via email after proper editing and noise reduction. The students of the institute use these recordings to revise for their exams which help them prepare well for the same. Constant feedback is taken from the school authorities for further improvement in aspiration that this small step will go a long way ahead. Streetplay Street play or Nukkad Natak is a form of theatrical performance in outdoor public spaces which aims at spreading awareness about various social and cultural issues prevailing in the society. NSS PEC has been organizing such plays for many years and the plays have gained so much appreciation which encourages them to do even better every year. Last year, a street play titled 'Jago bharat Jago' was performed by the astounding students of NSSPEC, portraying the three major issues prevalent in the society, namely Cleanliness, Women empowerment, and Alcohol Addiction. These plays if and as they are targeted towards youth can really stir up emotions, create awareness and lead the way towards positive change. Nukad nataks are an important tool in creating awareness, empowering the youth and utilizing our right to freedom of speech and expression positively. This colloquial form of drama connects with the youth instantly. This enthusiasm if used in the correct manner can lead to drastic changes in our society, changes we wish for. Achaar In this project, the NSS unit of PEC gets achaar prepared from the women of Self Help Groups. The unit provides them with the raw materials (mirchi, oil, salt, etc) at low costs and they prepare the achaar. The prepared achaar is sold at a price cheaper than the market price by NSS volunteers in the college. The money gained from selling the achaar is given to these women as compensation for their labour. This helps in their growth and fulfils the objective of Women Empowerment. It helps generate some employment for these women and provide them an identity of their own.

Continuing with the tradition, year after year, NSS volunteers distribute sweets to the policemen on duty at numerous traffic junctions and markets in the city. The volunteers thus offer gratitude to the policemen for serving the society and wish them a Happy Diwali. Workshop Coat Distribution Drive The NSS wing of PEC also holds a Workshop Coat Sale programme every year for newly joined students, coming in for the registrations and are provided with coats which would be required for their workshops. The coats are brought in from Ambala where they are made by people of Self Help Groups. NSS unit provides the coats at a price less than the regular price, with an aim to benefit the Self-Help Groups as well as the students. Thus here again NSS fulfils its motive to help all members of the society.

With the number of college graduates rising every year, employers must be strategic in selecting where to recruit. Punjab Engineering College is on the short list of technological institutes targeted by many elite companies because interns and full-time hires from PEC have been success within their organisations. The academic and leadership credentials of our students, the calibre of our accomplished faculty, the immaculate academic offerings based on IITs Academic Model and the variety of extracurricular education, available to our students come together to provide a unique and spectacular University. The Punjab Engineering College, Chandigarh was originally established as Mugalpura Engineering College at Lahore (now in Pakistan) on November 9, 1921. The name of the Institute was later changed to Maclagan Engineering College and its started functioning under the name on March 19, 1924. In the year 1931, the college got affiliated to Punjab University, Lahore. After partition in 1947, the Institute was shifted to Roorkee (India) and was renamed as East Punjab College of Engineering. In the year 1950 the word East was dropped and it came to know by the name Punjab Engineering College. Towards the end of December 1953, the Institute shifted to its present campus in Chandigarh to function under Govt. of Punjab. In 1966, with the formation of Union Territory of Chandigarh, the institute came under control of Govt. of India through Chandigarh Administration. In October 2003, the Govt. of India notified the Punjab Engineering College as a Deemed to be University and thereafter it became known as Punjab Engineering College (Deemed University). PEC holds the pride of being one of the first ever technological institutions in India, and has a glorious past which is about a century old. In addition, PEC has been nationally recognised as one of the finest technological universities in the country.

To develop and promote these forums, SAASC is categorized into five major socs: BookSoc DebSoc MunSoc QuizSoc Cognition Major Events by the club: Verve Among the many events, this club has hosted to develop the skills mentioned above in students, has been PECs only literary fest  Verve. Verve is a challenging fest that allows an individual to improve his or her thinking capability and help inculcate communication skills. At Verve, we hosted a series of events ranging from parliamentary debates, group discussions, just-a-minute sessions, and quizzes which saw the participation of students not only from the college but from all over the Tricity as well. Cash prizes up to a whopping 1 Lakh were awarded to the winners. PECMUN Model United Nations at PEC, called PECMUN, is not just an annual affair but a culture nurtured for the last ten years in SAASC. We have always wanted PECMUN to stand for a more excellent hopeful vision and help our delegates believe that they have it in themselves to change the world we live in for a better future! Students from various schools and colleges register for this event every year as delegates in a huge number. TRIVIUM Since SAASC is prominently known for its Debating Society, the annual Asian Parliamentary Debating Championship organized by SAASC is known as TRIVIUM. In TRIVIUM, master debaters from universities and colleges across India and an incredible Panel of Core Adjudicators are invited from across the country which raises the level of the tournament. During the tournament, participants savor the fun of debating excellent motions and winning big prizes. The students of PEC also get a chance to learn about debating from the best during the tournament. Every year the Intra-PEC PD is hosted by the club for the recruits so that they get a brief idea about parliamentary debating. Also, they are made aware of how a parliamentary house functions. The recruits form teams and are made to compete against each other, whereas the existing members adjudicate. IMPACT ON STUDENTS OF PEC All the activities in SAASC are done to build leadership qualities, good-speaking skills, a thirst for knowledge, logical thinking, and confidence, and to provide exposure and experience to the students of PEC. Since budding engineers are busy with technical education, their literary and communication skills must also be maintained and developed with time; that is the reason this club is significant in PEC. SAASC, as an organization, helps the budding engineers of PEC develop many essential skills necessary for their growth academically and socially.

The compassion and high spiritedness exhibited in the lifestyle of the people of Punjab along with its rich heritage is excellently presented by the Punjabi Editorial Board. Being one of the three Editorial Boards of PEC, PEB unceasingly brings forward the true essence of Punjab in the entirety of it. With numerous events and activities, it is one of the most active clubs which never fails to shower its members and its audience, all the same - with an unlimited amount of excitement and thrill. PEB has six disciplines under it, ensuring each and every member of the PEB fam has an opportunity to grow and take responsibilities in the field they feel driven and enthusiastic for. The various disciplines of PEB are: Bhangra Giddha Theatre Singing Malwai Giddha Literature Along with the energetic performances of Bhangra, Giddha, Malwai Giddha, Theatre and Singing; the diversity and the uniqueness of the state can be seen in the poetry, spirituality and the rich literature it has. In an effort to encapsulate the richness, PEBs literature includes poetry, magazines and folktale rendition- Mithihaas. The trail of exciting events starts with the Orientation performances where we welcome the budding engineers to PEC and introduce them to the warmth and fun of the Punjabi Editorial board while giving them a glimpse of the big happy family that we are. As soon as the students become part of the PEB fam, we welcome our new members with an enthralling event called DASTAK, where we encourage students to push their limits and get their first experience of the stage, in their first semester. PEB members can be seen showcasing their immense talent during our technical-cultural festival - PECFEST, in the event of Rang Punjab De. Our Bhangra teams' competitive spirit is brought out with the exciting Bhangra Theque during PECFEST where we always manage to bring home the glory and the trophy, of course. At last, a happy send-off to the PEB family in their last semester is the event called Raunakaan, where they take over the stage one last time but immortalize their experiences with nothing short of a blast. We at PEB, proudly claim that our members are always ready to take on the challenges of college life as they prepare to become responsible members of the Board and loyal friends to each other. They dont only brush their skills in various disciplines but also learn to handle success and failure like a boss.

A panel discussion was conducted emphasizing the role of universities in creating safe spaces for the LGBTQIA+ community. The past year has and continues to make us realize just how important it is to be true to ourselves. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76V-EnAjsyA Millennium Fellowship: Millennium Fellowship is a semester-long leadership development program focused on sustainable development goals. The Class of 2021 officially begins in August and ends on November 30. Throughout the program, Millennium Fellows commit to participating in various activities- training sessions, webinars and SDG Conversation Hours, and engaging in social impact work. Surkh: Surkh is an initiative by the Women Empowerment Cell (WEC) of Punjab Engineering College, Chandigarh under the guidance of Millennium Campus Network (MCN) and United Nations Academic Impact (UNAI). It is also affiliated with Unnat Bharat Abhiyan (UBA) and aims to advance Sustainable Development goals. It is a project aimed at increasing menstrual health awareness in rural villages and schools on the outskirts of Chandigarh, India. Menstrual health continues to be a stigmatized topic in many areas across the country, especially in rural areas. Surkh aims to destigmatize conversations around menstrual health and also increase the use of sustainable menstrual products. Hence a survey was conducted for all age groups (men and women) to analyze their views on menstruation and how they perceive it. GIF link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1D05SAVJ0n_uh-0pQiRSBxmgB4lbrZ8Fj/view?usp=sharing We welcome students of diverse interests and opinions since we strongly believe that society as a whole needs to be involved to drive social change. We provide a safe space. There is a place where students, not only girls, can express themselves as much as they want while being surrounded by their peers who respect and appreciate them. Give students a voice. Being part of a community that makes you feel safe, gives you the confidence to express yourself. Students learn that each of their voices matters. Bring awareness. It's an excellent way to educate students, teachers, staff and members of the community on Black Lives Matter, LGBTQ+ and any other underrepresented group (or movement) going on at campus (and worldwide).

Rs. 1.25Cr Start Date Completion Date Status 2015-09-01 2021-09-30 Completed Abstract The project is synthesis sintering and characterization of sesquioxides like YAG and yttrium oxide ceramics, particularly in the field of advance ceramics. YAG and Y2O3 is known for its excellent chemical stability, high melting point, thermal conductivity, and transparency in a wide spectral range. The traditional method of growing single crystals of Y2O3 faces challenges due to its high melting point, so polycrystalline transparent ceramics (PTCs) are used as an alternative, offering advantages such as easy fabrication and the ability to create complex structures. To lower the sintering temperature sesquioxides could be doped with sintering additives in a limited quantity so as not interfere with basic properties of sesquioxides. To enhance and observe altering the physical and chemical properties sesquioxides could be doped with Rare earth elements (REEs) can be doped. The project is about the development and compilation of various studies that focus on doping Y2O3 with REEs like erbium (Er3+), ytterbium (Yb3+), samarium (Sm3+), and europium (Eu3+), which significantly affect the characteristics of the material.

Rs. 60,31,808.00 Amount Received till date (in Rs.) Rs. 39,55,000.00 Start Date Completion Date Status 2022-12-27 Ongoing Abstract The Aim of this project is to design, develop and fabricate an integrated frequency multiplier utilizing a novel self-switching diode (SSD) based on GaN two-dimensional heterostructures. The SSD has an entirely different working principal which does not require any p-n junction and /or Schottky barrier to operate eliminating the requirement of an additional bias circuit than that of conventional and commercially available diodes. Due to planar and single-layered device architecture, SSD exhibits low parasitics resulting in a zero-bias rectification up to 1.5 THz at room temperatures with responsivity and NEP comparable to commercially available Schottky diodes. The SSD can easily be fabricated utilizing a single-step lithography followed by an etching process from using wide variety of materials varying from conventional Silicon to III-V heterostructures to novel graphene. On the other hand, commercially available Schottky barrier diodes, have multi-layered and vertical structure, and require an additional bias high enough to overcome the built-in electric field and to allow current flow. It further introduces the parasitic capacitance which in turn limits the operating speed and high frequency performance restricting to utilise a Schottky diode to generate very high microwave/ Terahertz frequencies. Schottky barrier diodes are commonly being utilised in array i.e. parallel or anti-parallel configuration for frequency multipliers to improve input/output power handling capacity. However, they suffer from excessive heat at the Schottky junctions leading to the performance degradation and require novel materials and challenging fabrication techniques to achieve ultra-low charge carrier transit time and parasitics at room temperature to generate high microwave/terahertz signals. Utilising excellent properties of GaN, SSD can be implemented for frequency multipliers to generate signals with hundreds of gigahertz frequencies with improved efficiency and high power handling capacity. Planar structure of device is more suitable as more number of SSDs in array configuration can be easily integrated without interconnects reducing overall device impedance exhibiting better noise properties at high frequencies. Further, heat dissipation can be managed efficiently by correct design of SSD channel. Therefore, developing GaN SSD based integrated frequency multiplier is timely given the rapid progress in the GaN technology and development of high frequency microwave/terahertz sources for wide variety of applications such as future generation communications, medical and security imaging etc. Additionally, training of early career researchers in this project will provide India with the scientists and engineers with the skills to transfer GaN-based technologies from academia to industry for industrial and/or strategic applications in line with Government of Indias Semiconductor Mission, Make in India, Aatmnirbhar Bharat, and Skill India Missions.

Rs. 50,58,000.00 Amount Received till date (in Rs.) Rs. 45,75,000.00 Total Expenditure: Rs. 47, 87, 525.00 Start Date Completion Date Status 2019-03-02 2022-06-01 Completed Abstract The aim of this project is to design and develop a novel nanoelectronic rectifier, also known as self-switching diode (SSD), from van der Waals hetrostructure consisting of graphene/h-BN/MoS2 layers. Due to excellent material properties, proposed SSDs can operate with ultra-fast switching speed than that of electronic rectifiers fabricated from conventional semiconductors for a wide variety of applications such as signal detection, future generation communications, medical and security imaging etc. Recently, emerging two-dimensional (2D)-layered semiconductors including graphene, hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and molybdenum disulphide (MoS2) have shown considerable potential for designing next-generation integrated electronic and optoelectronic devices, due to their excellent unique physical and structural properties. Particularly, the 2D-layered semiconductors of graphene, h-BN and MoS2 can be flexibly combined to form different configurations of vertical van der Waals heterostructures with atomically sharp interfaces and tunable band alignment, opening up vast opportunities for fundamental investigation of novel electronic properties at the limit of single atom thickness and potential applications in novel devices concept such as self-switching diode. The working of conventional rectifying diodes depend either upon a pn doped junction or a Schottky barrier, that also determines the limitations. An applied bias high enough is generally required to overcome the built-in electric field and to allow a significant current flow, introducing the parasitic capacitance which in turn limits the operating speed and high frequency performance. The novel nanodiode concept proposed in this project is entirely different and it has a singlelayered device architecture that is ideallysuited to graphene and/or graphene based van der Waals heterostructures. Moreover, it operates on new working principle enabling zero threshold voltage, thus eliminating the need for a bias circuit. Developing SSD in graphene/h-BN/MoS2 is timely given the rapid progress in graphene and/or 2d van der Waals material engineering. Since the device speed generally scales with the carrier mobility, the proposed SSDs are expected to operate at very high frequencies possibly up to THz.

Furthermore, the developed model predicts that minimum low frequency noise for both the devices which depends upon carrier concentration inside device active region rather than mobility, enables potential applications as THz detectors for imaging. Further, it has been demonstrated that symmetric geometry of both type of ballistic rectifiers, i.e. three terminals and four terminals, can be utilized as a thermoelectric rectifier for wide variety of applications to produce rectified output voltage converting thermal energy radiated from the electronic devices/ICs. Prototypes of ballistic rectifiers with and without antidot have been developed demonstrating rectification of microwave/RF signals. The development of this novel technology of Ballistic Rectifier can be used for various applications including future generation communications, signal detection, medical and security imaging.

Among other applications, nano-based sensing devices have received considerable attention, especially in medical and environmental monitoring. Recent developments have enabled the fabrication and application of sensing devices. My research talk will consist of the basic concepts of the fabrication of different modified electrode based sensor. Similarly, the fabrication of bacteria sensor associated with urinary tract infections, herbicide atrazine, and electrochemical determination of cancer biomarker sensors will also be presented, highlighting its advantages over other conventional sensors, as reported by my recent publication. Flexible consumer electronic products, such as folding displays, health monitoring devices, smart fabrics, and flexible body sensors, have gotten a lot of attention since they can be utilised for flexible and wearable electronic gadgets. Lightweight, flexible, and large storage capacity are all requirements for an energy storage system to power these functional devices. Flexible supercapacitors, with their high power densities, extended life, and quick charge/discharge rates, have been highlighted as a possible solution for such needs. I am currently working on the development of high energy density conducting polymer based supercapacitor for energy storage applications. Energy conversion (EC) devices that are environmentally friendly and efficient are critical for the production of sustainable energy. Direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs) are potential EC devices for supplying power to portable electronic devices and electric vehicles, with the slow methanol electrooxidation reaction (MEOR) kinetics at the anode being the main constraint. Platinum (Pt) is typically the most advantageous choice for electrocatalysis in the MEOR due to its distinct d-band configuration, which allows for rapid methanol adsorption and dissociation. However, the high cost and proclivity to poison render widespread commercial Platinum (Pt)-based electrocatalysis in DMFCs unviable. My attempt is to rationally integrate Copper, Nickel and Cobalt based materials in order to create a novel composite that could be used effectively in DMFCs. Hydrogen has been recognised as a future fuel that could help solve the energy crisis caused by fossil-fuel exhaustion. The most abundant element in the universe is hydrogen. Hydrogen has a higher combustion enthalpy and produces zero-pollution. Hydrogen (H2) fuel cells have a lot of potential in transportation and stationary applications, but their widespread commercialization is hampered by their expensive cost. Because platinum (Pt) is one of the most expensive components of a fuel cell, numerous R&D efforts have focused on ways to improve the activity, as well as platinum free catalysts for long-term applications. My research project also focuses on two ways to addressing catalyst challenges: low-Pt catalysts and Pt-free catalysts. Manpower Sanctioned/Hired Manpower Trained M.Tech.

Rs. 1.25Cr Start Date Completion Date Status 2015-09-01 2021-09-30 Completed Abstract The project is synthesis sintering and characterization of sesquioxides like YAG and yttrium oxide ceramics, particularly in the field of advance ceramics. YAG and Y2O3 is known for its excellent chemical stability, high melting point, thermal conductivity, and transparency in a wide spectral range. The traditional method of growing single crystals of Y2O3 faces challenges due to its high melting point, so polycrystalline transparent ceramics (PTCs) are used as an alternative, offering advantages such as easy fabrication and the ability to create complex structures. To lower the sintering temperature sesquioxides could be doped with sintering additives in a limited quantity so as not interfere with basic properties of sesquioxides. To enhance and observe altering the physical and chemical properties sesquioxides could be doped with Rare earth elements (REEs) can be doped. The project is about the development and compilation of various studies that focus on doping Y2O3 with REEs like erbium (Er3+), ytterbium (Yb3+), samarium (Sm3+), and europium (Eu3+), which significantly affect the characteristics of the material.

Rs. 60,31,808.00 Amount Received till date (in Rs.) Rs. 39,55,000.00 Start Date Completion Date Status 2022-12-27 Ongoing Abstract The Aim of this project is to design, develop and fabricate an integrated frequency multiplier utilizing a novel self-switching diode (SSD) based on GaN two-dimensional heterostructures. The SSD has an entirely different working principal which does not require any p-n junction and /or Schottky barrier to operate eliminating the requirement of an additional bias circuit than that of conventional and commercially available diodes. Due to planar and single-layered device architecture, SSD exhibits low parasitics resulting in a zero-bias rectification up to 1.5 THz at room temperatures with responsivity and NEP comparable to commercially available Schottky diodes. The SSD can easily be fabricated utilizing a single-step lithography followed by an etching process from using wide variety of materials varying from conventional Silicon to III-V heterostructures to novel graphene. On the other hand, commercially available Schottky barrier diodes, have multi-layered and vertical structure, and require an additional bias high enough to overcome the built-in electric field and to allow current flow. It further introduces the parasitic capacitance which in turn limits the operating speed and high frequency performance restricting to utilise a Schottky diode to generate very high microwave/ Terahertz frequencies. Schottky barrier diodes are commonly being utilised in array i.e. parallel or anti-parallel configuration for frequency multipliers to improve input/output power handling capacity. However, they suffer from excessive heat at the Schottky junctions leading to the performance degradation and require novel materials and challenging fabrication techniques to achieve ultra-low charge carrier transit time and parasitics at room temperature to generate high microwave/terahertz signals. Utilising excellent properties of GaN, SSD can be implemented for frequency multipliers to generate signals with hundreds of gigahertz frequencies with improved efficiency and high power handling capacity. Planar structure of device is more suitable as more number of SSDs in array configuration can be easily integrated without interconnects reducing overall device impedance exhibiting better noise properties at high frequencies. Further, heat dissipation can be managed efficiently by correct design of SSD channel. Therefore, developing GaN SSD based integrated frequency multiplier is timely given the rapid progress in the GaN technology and development of high frequency microwave/terahertz sources for wide variety of applications such as future generation communications, medical and security imaging etc. Additionally, training of early career researchers in this project will provide India with the scientists and engineers with the skills to transfer GaN-based technologies from academia to industry for industrial and/or strategic applications in line with Government of Indias Semiconductor Mission, Make in India, Aatmnirbhar Bharat, and Skill India Missions.

Rs. 50,58,000.00 Amount Received till date (in Rs.) Rs. 45,75,000.00 Total Expenditure: Rs. 47, 87, 525.00 Start Date Completion Date Status 2019-03-02 2022-06-01 Completed Abstract The aim of this project is to design and develop a novel nanoelectronic rectifier, also known as self-switching diode (SSD), from van der Waals hetrostructure consisting of graphene/h-BN/MoS2 layers. Due to excellent material properties, proposed SSDs can operate with ultra-fast switching speed than that of electronic rectifiers fabricated from conventional semiconductors for a wide variety of applications such as signal detection, future generation communications, medical and security imaging etc. Recently, emerging two-dimensional (2D)-layered semiconductors including graphene, hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and molybdenum disulphide (MoS2) have shown considerable potential for designing next-generation integrated electronic and optoelectronic devices, due to their excellent unique physical and structural properties. Particularly, the 2D-layered semiconductors of graphene, h-BN and MoS2 can be flexibly combined to form different configurations of vertical van der Waals heterostructures with atomically sharp interfaces and tunable band alignment, opening up vast opportunities for fundamental investigation of novel electronic properties at the limit of single atom thickness and potential applications in novel devices concept such as self-switching diode. The working of conventional rectifying diodes depend either upon a pn doped junction or a Schottky barrier, that also determines the limitations. An applied bias high enough is generally required to overcome the built-in electric field and to allow a significant current flow, introducing the parasitic capacitance which in turn limits the operating speed and high frequency performance. The novel nanodiode concept proposed in this project is entirely different and it has a singlelayered device architecture that is ideallysuited to graphene and/or graphene based van der Waals heterostructures. Moreover, it operates on new working principle enabling zero threshold voltage, thus eliminating the need for a bias circuit. Developing SSD in graphene/h-BN/MoS2 is timely given the rapid progress in graphene and/or 2d van der Waals material engineering. Since the device speed generally scales with the carrier mobility, the proposed SSDs are expected to operate at very high frequencies possibly up to THz.

Furthermore, the developed model predicts that minimum low frequency noise for both the devices which depends upon carrier concentration inside device active region rather than mobility, enables potential applications as THz detectors for imaging. Further, it has been demonstrated that symmetric geometry of both type of ballistic rectifiers, i.e. three terminals and four terminals, can be utilized as a thermoelectric rectifier for wide variety of applications to produce rectified output voltage converting thermal energy radiated from the electronic devices/ICs. Prototypes of ballistic rectifiers with and without antidot have been developed demonstrating rectification of microwave/RF signals. The development of this novel technology of Ballistic Rectifier can be used for various applications including future generation communications, signal detection, medical and security imaging.

Among other applications, nano-based sensing devices have received considerable attention, especially in medical and environmental monitoring. Recent developments have enabled the fabrication and application of sensing devices. My research talk will consist of the basic concepts of the fabrication of different modified electrode based sensor. Similarly, the fabrication of bacteria sensor associated with urinary tract infections, herbicide atrazine, and electrochemical determination of cancer biomarker sensors will also be presented, highlighting its advantages over other conventional sensors, as reported by my recent publication. Flexible consumer electronic products, such as folding displays, health monitoring devices, smart fabrics, and flexible body sensors, have gotten a lot of attention since they can be utilised for flexible and wearable electronic gadgets. Lightweight, flexible, and large storage capacity are all requirements for an energy storage system to power these functional devices. Flexible supercapacitors, with their high power densities, extended life, and quick charge/discharge rates, have been highlighted as a possible solution for such needs. I am currently working on the development of high energy density conducting polymer based supercapacitor for energy storage applications. Energy conversion (EC) devices that are environmentally friendly and efficient are critical for the production of sustainable energy. Direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs) are potential EC devices for supplying power to portable electronic devices and electric vehicles, with the slow methanol electrooxidation reaction (MEOR) kinetics at the anode being the main constraint. Platinum (Pt) is typically the most advantageous choice for electrocatalysis in the MEOR due to its distinct d-band configuration, which allows for rapid methanol adsorption and dissociation. However, the high cost and proclivity to poison render widespread commercial Platinum (Pt)-based electrocatalysis in DMFCs unviable. My attempt is to rationally integrate Copper, Nickel and Cobalt based materials in order to create a novel composite that could be used effectively in DMFCs. Hydrogen has been recognised as a future fuel that could help solve the energy crisis caused by fossil-fuel exhaustion. The most abundant element in the universe is hydrogen. Hydrogen has a higher combustion enthalpy and produces zero-pollution. Hydrogen (H2) fuel cells have a lot of potential in transportation and stationary applications, but their widespread commercialization is hampered by their expensive cost. Because platinum (Pt) is one of the most expensive components of a fuel cell, numerous R&D efforts have focused on ways to improve the activity, as well as platinum free catalysts for long-term applications. My research project also focuses on two ways to addressing catalyst challenges: low-Pt catalysts and Pt-free catalysts. Manpower Sanctioned/Hired Manpower Trained M.Tech.
